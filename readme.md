# Eurosystem Governing Council Decision Model

This repository presents our project that focuses on modeling the discussion and voting mechanism of the Governing Council, the decision-making body of the Eurosystem. Our model delves into the negotiation process preceding interest rate votes, incorporating two key assumptions. Firstly, we divide agents into two subgroups - hawks and doves. Secondly, we assume homogeneous preferences within each group, effectively treating them as distinct agents. We leverage the concepts of Nash equilibrium and Rationalizability to analyze this model.

### Code_for_numerical_computations

This directory contains the code necessary for numerical computations. It includes:
- `plot.py`: Python script for generating plots.
- `rationalizability/`: Subdirectory for rationalizability-related code.

### Latex_output

This directory holds LaTeX output files.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Code_for_numerical_computations/` directory to access the computational code.
3. Utilize `plot.py` to generate necessary plots.
4. Utilize `rationalizability.py` to generate necessary plots.
5. Access the `Latex_output/` directory for LaTeX output files.
6. Copy and paste in the latex folder or change the latex code so the latex compiler can find the output png files
